  about_markdown: |
    I see myself as a public servant. Being able to help people with their real estate needs is a passion of mine! When we work together, I can promise that I will do everything possible to make the purchase or sale of your home as easy and pleasant as possible. When problems arise, we will make sure they get taken care of. When you have a question or concern, call me and I'll make sure you feel at ease. I look at my clients as family, and I would never treat a family member with anything but the absolute best service.

    Being a native Phoenician, I've seen different parts of the city grow and develop. When I was growing up in Central Phoenix, 7th Street, or "Restaurant Row" as it's now called, had almost no restaurants! Seeing growth like this has allowed me to develop a keen eye for up and coming areas. Furthermore, being born and raised here has allotted me the opportunity to know every part of the city like the back of my hand! I often know good schools, and ALWAYS know good restaurants in certain areas (eating is my favorite hobby).
