Buying a house is a major investment for many people. Therefore, it makes a lot of sense to ask about what to expect when buying a home. Most people reach out to me saying that they want to purchase a house but are not sure about the process. I’m here to provide a high-level overview of what to expect during the home-buying process.

**1\. Pre-qualification.** Talk with a lender and get pre-qualified to give you an idea of how much you can afford to spend on a home. If you don’t have a lender in mind, I’m happy to provide a referral.

**2\. Home shopping.** Once you get your pre-approval, you can start looking for homes in your desired area and price range. The price you’re pre-qualified for is a big factor when choosing a property.

**3\. Make an offer.** When you find a home that you like, it’s time to make an offer based on the comps in your area and how much you’re willing to pay.

**4\. Inspection period.** If your offer is accepted, you can proceed with the inspection period. It is usually a ten-day period during which you can inspect the home or have it inspected to identify potential issues and maybe get bids on some work that needs to be done.

**5\. Appraisal.** The lender will send out a third-party appraiser after the inspection period. The appraiser will determine the home’s value to ensure that the loan amount is not higher than the worth of the property.

**6\. Final walkthrough and closing.** Once the appraisal is done and the necessary repairs are addressed, you’ll do a final walkthrough of the house to ensure it’s move-in ready. Then, it’s time to close on the property and officially become a homeowner.

The process is simple, and with the right guidance and preparation, you can have a smooth home-buying experience. **If you have any questions about a specific step, please feel free to call me at (602) 501-9352 or email me at** [sam@thebrokery.com](mailto:sam@thebrokery.com)**.** I’d love to help.
