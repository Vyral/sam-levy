If you're trying to build credit, I'm going to give you a few tips to help you increase your score. **First, make your payments on time.** I know this sounds very rudimentary, but I promise you that making your payment on time can do a lot to boost your score.&nbsp;

**Second, don’t open a ton of cards;** make sure you don't close any cards you do open.&nbsp;

**Finally, have good debt utilization.** This is essentially the percentage of your potential credit you’re using. So let's say you have a $10,000 credit limit, and you're spending $3,000 a month. That's a 30% utilization rate. You want to try to keep this as low as possible. This shows the credit bureaus that you're reliable and you're not spending the max that you can every month.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about this topic or anything else, please call or email me. I look forward to hearing from you.
