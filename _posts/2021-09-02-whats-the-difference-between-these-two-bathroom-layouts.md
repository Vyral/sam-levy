Today I want to briefly explain the difference between an en suite bathroom and a Jack and Jill bathroom. Every now and then, you’ll hear these buzz words thrown around and I just wanted to quickly clear it up.&nbsp;

**An en suite bathroom is a bathroom that is connected to a bedroom. A Jack and Jill bathroom is a bathroom that’s between two bedrooms that feed into the same bathroom.&nbsp;**
