Have you ever been to the Encanto historic district? It’s a lovely place, and today I’m visiting it to get a testimonial from a couple I recently helped purchase a home here.&nbsp;

Ben, Sydney, and I met back in the first grade, so I was thrilled when they asked me to help them purchase a home. According to Sydney, the constant communication was a big plus. She always felt like she knew what was happening.&nbsp;

Before they bought the house in Encanto, Ben and Sydney had to sell their old property. This was the first time they ever had to sell a home, so I enjoyed showing them what they needed to do to get the most money possible out of their sale.&nbsp;

According to Ben, “**Recommending Sam is a no-brainer**. He’s one of the best agents in town, and he makes you feel like you’re his only client.”

If you have questions about today’s topic or anything else, please call or email me. I look forward to hearing from you\!
