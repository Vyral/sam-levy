The Phoenix market is currently very strong—and I don’t see us slowing down anytime soon.

With all the turmoil that the coronavirus and everything else has caused in the world, many markets are facing a lot of uncertainty. The greater Phoenix market, however, is exploding—cities like Chandler, Gilbert, Levine, Peoria, Anthem, and others are experiencing a lot of growth. I don’t predict it’ll slow down anytime soon for a few reasons:

**1\. Pricing**. The market here continues to grow, in part due to the fact that it’s still relatively cheap here compared to the rest of the country. What you can get here for $500,000 is very different from what you can get in Los Angeles for the same amount.

**2\. Job security**. Large companies like Intel have begun to move here, bringing jobs with them.

**3\. Population growth.** Around 250 people move to the greater Phoenix area every single day.
