If you’re a Phoenix homeowner thinking about selling and upgrading, one of the biggest decisions you’ll face is where to go next. A bigger house, a better location, or maybe just a change of scenery, and it all starts with picking the right neighborhood.

Here are three of our top picks for move-up buyers right now:

**1\. Arcadia Lite.** This area has that rare balance of family-friendly charm, beautiful green spaces, and great access to local favorites and central Phoenix. It’s perfect if you want that classic neighborhood feel without being too far from the action.

**2\. North Central Phoenix.** If you want a bit more bang for your buck without sacrificing location, North Central Phoenix is a great option. This neighborhood is known for its community atmosphere, established homes, and proximity to excellent schools and local hotspots.

**3\. PV Mall Area (Paradise Valley Mall).** This one is all about potential. The Paradise Valley Mall area is undergoing massive redevelopment, and that means opportunity for buyers. Property values here are expected to rise significantly in the next three to five years.

Whether you’re upgrading for more space, better schools, or future equity, choosing the right neighborhood matters.
