Over the last few years, Phoenix's downtown area has seen a complete overhaul. A lot of people have been waiting for the housing market to catch up downtown, and that is finally starting to happen. **Today, I'm excited to show you one of the hottest new builds in one of the coolest neighborhoods around.**
