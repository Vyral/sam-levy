There are two questions that I’ve been hearing a lot that essentially ask the same thing: Is now a good time to buy, and should I try to time the market?

**The short answer is no.** When you're buying a home, you’re probably doing so out of a need. Whether you’re having another child, the kids are moving out, or you’re getting married, life dictates your move; not the market.&nbsp;

If your home isn’t a strict investment, don’t look at it as one. Purchase it because you need it, not because you want to make money from it.

Interest rates are starting to tick up, so now is a fantastic time to lock a rate in and purchase your next home. Rates could fall, but that seems very unlikely at this point. **The best time to buy a home is when it’s right for you.**

If you have any questions for me about buying a home or real estate in general, please don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
