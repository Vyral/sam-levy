Today, we’re at the Future of Phoenix event to help out G Road, a nonprofit that’s very near and dear to my heart.&nbsp;

This event is all about community and helping the youth in The Square. There was music, dancing, blackjack, prize giveaways, and much more. I’m bringing you along today to get a first-hand view. **Please watch the video above to see for yourself.**

If you have any real estate-related questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon\!
