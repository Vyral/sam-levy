I get this question often: “I want to sell my house. What should I do to prepare, and what should I expect throughout the process?" I’ll give you an overview of the process in a way that’s easy to understand.

**Getting ready to sell.** If you want to profit from your home, we must prepare it for some great photos and videos. This means your home should be clean, depersonalized, and as decluttered as possible to give your home a fresh look for potential buyers.

**Listing your home.** Once your home is all prepped and ready, we will list it next. We will put it on the Multiple Listing Service (MLS). From there, it gets syndicated to all the big websites. This is when your home officially hits the market.

Showings and open houses. Expect showings at various times of the day and on various days. We will also have open houses, which bring in a lot of foot traffic through your house.

Showings can happen anytime, such as 3:00 p.m. on a Monday or 6:00 p.m. on a Sunday. As a seller, you need to be ready to move and leave the house at a moment’s notice—think an hour or two.

**Receiving offers.** After showings, we’ll start receiving offers. This is where pricing your house correctly is crucial. Why? First, you want to attract buyers to look at your home. Second, even if we get a high offer, we still have to pass the appraisal process.

If your home isn’t in line with comparable sales in the neighborhood, you might not pass the appraisal. This means we need to renegotiate the price with the buyer and extend the selling process.

**Inspections and appraisal.** Once we get under contract, the home inspection comes next. This is just like what you went through when you bought your current home. The inspection usually takes about four hours, and during that time, the buyer checks everything from the windows to doors to the HVAC unit. If some issues or repairs need to be addressed, we may have some negotiations afterward.

Home appraisal comes next, where a professional appraiser evaluates your property to determine its fair market value. Once we clear the appraisal, it’ll be time to close, and you’ll be ready to move on to your new home.
