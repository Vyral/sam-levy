Are you struggling to separate your wants from your must-haves when buying a home? It’s easy to get caught up in the excitement of finding your dream home and focusing on all the shiny features. However, it’s essential to zero in on your must-haves first.

**What are must-haves?** These are the essentials you absolutely need in your new home. Consider factors like:

• Location

• Lot size

• Square footage

• Garage or potential for one

**These are crucial because they can impact your daily life and the long-term value of your home.**

On the other hand, we have wants. These nice-to-have features can make your home feel special but aren’t necessarily deal-breakers. Examples include:

• Quartz countertops

• New floors

• Other cosmetic upgrades

**While these features are great, they can be changed or updated later.**

Weigh your must-haves against your wants to make sure you’re making the best choice for yourself and your family. If you focus too much on your wants, you might overlook a home that meets your needs.
