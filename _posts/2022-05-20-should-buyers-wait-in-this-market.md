“Is it still a good time to buy a home?” I’m asked this question frequently by buyers in today’s market, and in my opinion, there are two main reasons why it’s still a great time to purchase a home:

**1\. Interest rates are still rising.** If you want to purchase a home, you need to move fast before rates rise even further.

**2\. The market isn’t slowing down anytime soon.** You may have less competition for homes than before, but prices aren’t going down for a long time. The longer you wait, the more expensive it will be to buy.&nbsp;

If you’re looking to buy, it will pay to move sooner rather than later. Please call or email me with any questions you might have. I look forward to hearing from you\!
