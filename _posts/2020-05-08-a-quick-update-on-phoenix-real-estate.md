<p style="text=align: center;"><em>Here’s how our market has been affected by COVID-19.</em></p>

Phoenix is a unique real estate market that’s in a rare position right now. We had very low inventory before the pandemic started and many people think it will balance out afterward. Inventory has gone up, but we’re still in a strong seller’s market.

With people moving here in droves from California, Chicago, and New York, they want more land, and compared to where they’re from, the cost of living here is low. To learn more about what our real estate market looks like now and what I think it will look like in the future, watch this short video.
