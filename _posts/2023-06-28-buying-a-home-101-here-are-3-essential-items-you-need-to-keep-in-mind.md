What should buyers look for when touring homes? There’s a lot you need to consider, but in my opinion, three factors stand out as the most important:&nbsp;

**1\. Focus on location.** You can’t change a home’s location, so make sure it works for things like schools, work, and other important features of your life.&nbsp;

**2\. Find out your wants and needs.** Create a list that helps you separate and prioritize your wants and needs. For example, if you need a garage, don’t bother looking at houses without one.&nbsp;

**3\. Determine the condition of the home.** When you first walk into a house, your agent is probably looking for signs of the home’s overall condition. However, you need to look at the fit. For example, does the floor plan fit your family?&nbsp;

The truth is that looking for a home is mostly based on feel, which is why I always recommend my clients visit at least 10 to 20 houses before getting serious about writing offers. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call or email me with any questions you might have. I look forward to hearing from you!
