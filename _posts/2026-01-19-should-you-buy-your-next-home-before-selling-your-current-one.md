If you’re planning a move, there’s one question that almost always comes up early: Should I buy my new home before selling my current one?

I get asked this all the time, and the answer comes down to a few practical factors that can make the process smooth or stressful.

**The first thing to look at is whether you can carry two mortgages at the same time.** That means being able to afford your current home’s mortgage while also paying for the new one.

**Next thing, just as important is having enough cash for the down payment on the next home.**

If both of those boxes are checked, buying before selling can be a solid option. It gives you flexibility. You can move without rushing, avoid temporary housing, and focus on finding the right home instead of settling because of timing pressure.

At the end of the day, the goal is simple: **make a move that fits your finances and keeps your stress level in check.** There isn’t a one-size-fits-all answer, but there is a right answer for your situation.
