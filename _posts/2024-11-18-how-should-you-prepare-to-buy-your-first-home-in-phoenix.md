Are you thinking about buying your first home in Phoenix? You’re not alone. The market is competitive right now, and I’ve learned a thing or two that could help you. Here’s a tip when prepping to buy your first home, or any home for that matter.

The most important thing you can do is **make a list of your wants versus needs**. It doesn’t matter what your price range is; we all have things we want and things we absolutely need. An example of this would be needing three bedrooms because you have children or wanting a three-car garage because you have an extra car.

If these are true for you, *focus on what you need and make sure those are being met* when you search, along with at least one or two features that you want. It’s all about finding that balance.

You can live with the ones you don't have and add them later if you really want them, like installing a pool or adding a sliding glass door. Things like this can be changed.

What’s much harder to change is the **location**, the **size of the home**, and **how close you are to the things you enjoy doing**. You can’t just pick up your house and move it closer to your favorite coffee shop or park.

As you get ready to buy, seriously consider making that needs versus wants list first. It’s a simple step, but it can clarify what you’re looking for in your new home.
