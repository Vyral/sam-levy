If you’ve read or listened to anything about real estate lately, I’m sure you have some idea about what’s happening in the market. It’s changing rapidly; inventory is rising, while demand is slightly falling. These shifts are due to two main factors.&nbsp;

The first factor is interest rates: They’ve been steadily increasing for a while, but they’re still low compared to historical averages. The second factor is that many sellers are worried they missed their window of opportunity and now want to put their homes on the market to take advantage of their equity. These two factors are creating an entirely different real estate market than we’ve seen for the last few years. However, **there’s still plenty of opportunity in our market for both buyers and sellers**.
