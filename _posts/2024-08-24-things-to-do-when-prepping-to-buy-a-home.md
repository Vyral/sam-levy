Are you planning on purchasing a home soon? The Phoenix market is highly competitive for buyers these days. To help you prepare when buying your first home, or any home for that matter, here are a few tips for you.

**1\. Make a list of wants versus needs.** Regardless of your budget, everyone has things they want and things they absolutely need. Focus on the features that you need the most, and then consider your wants. For example, you might need three bedrooms for your children or a three-car garage for an extra vehicle.

**2\. Satisfy at least one or two wants**. Aim to fulfill at least one or two needs, and be prepared to live with the ones you don’t have. Some features, like a pool or sliding glass door, can be added later.

**3\. Prioritize things you can’t change.** Consider aspects of your home that you cannot easily change, like location, size, or proximity to amenities. These are important factors to keep in mind when making decisions about your living space.

When preparing to buy, having a list of your wants and needs can guide you as you look for your ideal home. If you have any questions about buying your next home, please reach out to me. **You can call me at (602) 501-9352 or send me an email at sam@thebrokery.com.**
