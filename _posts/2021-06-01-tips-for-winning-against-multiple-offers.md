It’s critical to have the right strategy if you’re buying a home in this market. Pretty much every home is receiving multiple offers, so you need to be able to compete. **Obviously, put your best foot forward from the start and get creative by waiving contingencies if you can.**

You could also write the seller a “love letter” where you talk about your family and how much you like the home. You could even make a video and send it to them.

If you have any questions for me about buying a home in Phoenix or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
