At first glance, it looks like buyers have more options than ever. Homes are sitting on the market, inventory feels high, and you'd think that means it's a great time to buy. So why is it still so hard to find something worth pursuing? Why does it feel like nothing is moving? I've been hearing these questions constantly, and today, I’ll share the three reasons behind it all:

**1\. Many listings just aren't worth your time.** The truth is, there's a lot of bad inventory out there. Overpriced homes, not updated, or simply not appealing, are flooding the market. These properties sit for weeks or months without serious interest. As a buyer, it makes your search feel longer and more frustrating because you're seeing more homes, but very few that actually meet your standards.

**2\. Higher interest rates are changing how buyers think.** Interest rates are still high, and that affects everything. With higher monthly payments, buyers are naturally more cautious. You want to make sure you're buying the right home at the right price. That caution is completely valid, but it also means buyers are slower to act, which leads to longer days on market and a growing inventory of stale listings.

**3\. Sellers are focused on yesterday's prices.** Here's one of the biggest issues. Many sellers are still thinking in terms of last year's market. They expect top dollar, even though today's market looks different. Buyers, on the other hand, are thinking ahead. You're focused on current rates, the actual value, and whether the home makes sense for your future. This mismatch is what creates the gap between what's listed and what's actually selling.
