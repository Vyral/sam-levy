Today we’re taking a break from the usual real estate content to give thanks once again. **The Tuesday before Thanksgiving, we gave away pies** from our north-central office. Watch the video above to see footage of our great event. We hope you can attend one of them in the future\!

If you ever have any real estate questions or needs, give us a call. We would love to help you.
