What is the current state of the real estate market? Is it crashing or stabilizing? Today, I'll provide a breakdown of my perspective on the market's trajectory. Looking back over the past couple of years, we experienced historic high prices, low interest rates, and a bustling market. However, we are now transitioning to what I consider a more normal market.

Prices have stabilized, and interest rates have slightly increased, leading to cautious buyers and sellers. **Inventory levels have risen but are starting to decline, which is a positive sign.** Currently, our market is in a phase of stabilization. Looking ahead, I anticipate the market to remain relatively steady for the next 1 to 3 years.

We can expect a slower appreciation and potential interest rate drops, driving increased activity. However, I don't foresee a market crash. Instead, we are heading towards a much-needed stabilization, following the irrational behavior seen in 2020 and 2021. The normalization of pricing and market conditions is being driven by factors such as interest rates and inventory.

This trend is likely to continue, presenting buyers with excellent opportunities to find their dream homes and giving sellers the chance to leverage their equity. **I don't anticipate a significant market downturn or substantial fluctuations in interest rates.** So, if you're considering buying, now is a fantastic time to enter the market. And if you're thinking of selling, you can still take advantage of favorable equity conditions.
