**When is the best time to upgrade?** This is not an easy question, but here are some examples of ideal times for an upgrade: If you recently went through a life change, like having a new baby, it's a great time to buy a new house. Maybe you got a new job and want to move into a new neighborhood. If your kids are becoming school-aged and you need to get into a certain school district, that's also a great time to upgrade.&nbsp;

**When is a good time to downsize?** The answer to this common question is different for everybody. In my opinion, it’s when you want to. Consider downsizing if you think that your house is too big, if your kids moved out for college, if you no longer want to be in a certain neighborhood, or if you want to capitalize on your equity.&nbsp;

If you have more questions about upgrading or downsizing, don’t hesitate to reach out to me by phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you.
