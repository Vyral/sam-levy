When you’re buying a home, especially in Phoenix, it’s easy to focus on getting your offer accepted and moving forward quickly. But before you close, there is one step I always recommend to my clients 100% of the time: **get a home inspection.**

There are several important reasons for that.

**1\. Clarity and peace of mind.** A professional inspector checks the major systems and components of the home so you understand its condition before you take ownership. That includes plumbing, electrical, roof, and more.

For example, if the inspection reveals a major plumbing issue under the house that could cost $10,000 to repair, you find that out before closing, not after. That kind of information matters when you’re making a major financial decision.

**2\. Protect your earnest money.** If the inspection uncovers issues you’re not prepared to handle, you have the option to cancel the contract during the inspection period. In that case, you can get your earnest money back.

That protection gives you flexibility. You are not locked into a purchase if the condition of the home no longer makes sense for your budget.

**3\. Negotiating leverage.** An inspection also gives you leverage. You can present the findings to the seller and request repairs, ask for a credit, or negotiate a price reduction.

If you can’t come to an agreement, you still have the option to cancel within the inspection period and recover your earnest money.

A home inspection isn’t about nitpicking small issues. It’s about understanding the property and protecting yourself as a buyer.
