“Should I buy my new home before selling my last home?” I’ve been asked this question a lot recently.&nbsp;

To answer it, **you need to know if you can afford both mortgages at the same time and whether you have enough cash for the down payment on the new house.** If both answers are yes, maybe you should consider buying before selling. That will make the process much smoother. However, if you can't, you can do a simultaneous close where you buy and sell at the same time.

If you're thinking about selling your house, please feel free to reach out to me. I have a lot of experience with these transactions and I would love to answer any questions you have.
