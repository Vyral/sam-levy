Are you also waiting for the “perfect” real estate market before buying a home? Let me tell you a quick story. I recently closed with a client I’d been working with since 2018. That’s six years of searching, viewing homes, and analyzing the market, six years of trying to figure out when the “right time” would be.

During that stretch, **we watched the market shift again and again**. Home prices climbed, interest rates rose, and at times, it felt like the window of opportunity was closing. But they kept waiting, hoping for the perfect moment.

Finally, in 2024, they shifted their focus to what they truly needed in a home and found one that felt right. They bought it, and they’re incredibly happy with their decision.

While I’m genuinely thrilled for them, I can’t help but think of all the equity and benefits they missed by waiting six years to make a purchase. The key takeaway here is:

Stop trying to time the market. It doesn’t work for buyers or sellers.

**Real estate markets are constantly changing, making it nearly impossible to pinpoint the exact lowest price to buy or the highest price to sell.** Most people only realize those moments after they’ve passed.

If you’re in a position where buying a home meets your needs, that’s the best timing you’ll get. Waiting for interest rates to drop or prices to fall might lead to years of missed opportunities while your buying power shrinks.
