What is the state of our current Phoenix market? Right now, our market is changing rapidly but remains strong. I’ll go over some trends that we’re seeing in the market and share some tips on what you can do as a buyer or seller.

There’s a lot of buyer activity across all price points, and while inventory in our area is low, good houses sell quickly, even with higher interest rates. **Good homes in ideal locations typically sell within 30 days or less,** although some remain on the market longer.

If you’re a buyer struggling to find a home or getting your offer accepted, \*\* \*\* consider looking at homes that have been on the market for a while and offer a price with room for negotiation. This allows you to customize your offer to include seller concessions, home repairs, or commission negotiations.

**If you’re a seller, make sure that your house is priced competitively** since overpricing your house can turn off potential buyers. Look at the comparable sales in your area and be realistic with your agent so you can price your home accordingly. Even in a strong market, if your house is not exactly what the buyer wants, it may stay on the market longer.

**Overall, our market is strong and doesn’t seem to be slowing down.** If you have any questions about buying or selling your house, please contact me. You can call me at (602) 501-9352 or email me at [sam@thebrokery.com](mailto:sam@thebrokery.com).
