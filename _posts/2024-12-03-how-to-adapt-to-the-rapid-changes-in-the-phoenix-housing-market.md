The Phoenix market is changing rapidly. How do we adapt to these changes as a homebuyer or seller? I can see a couple of trends in the market and will share with you how to monitor them so you can make the right decisions in your transactions.

**Inventory.** Currently, the inventory is low, with houses moving fast even though interest rates are higher than they once were, like in 2020 and 2021.

**Buyer activity and market dynamics.** Phoenix buyers are active across all price points. Good homes in desirable locations are often moving in 30 days or less. However, there are houses staying on the market for a longer time.

If you’re a buyer who’s having trouble getting a house under contract, talk with your agent and **consider looking at homes that haven’t sold yet.** That way, you can make an offer that gives you a little wiggle room to make changes to the house later.

If you’re on the selling side, here’s my advice: be strategic about your pricing. Review comparable homes, or “comps,” in your area to determine the right price for your home. Although homes are moving quickly, they may sit unsold if your home is not exactly what buyers want. Be realistic with your agent and price accordingly.
