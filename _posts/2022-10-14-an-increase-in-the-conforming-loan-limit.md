In Arizona, the conforming loan limit has gone from $647,200 to $715,000 for 2023. What does that mean? **Now a conventional loan can be financed up to that higher price.** In a nutshell, you can get a bigger house without having to go with a jumbo loan, which has worse terms, and forces you to put more money down. This is a big benefit for homebuyers in Arizona in the upcoming year.&nbsp;
