How do you set up a good showing? Sellers ask me this question all the time, and the answer is very simple! **Make sure the house is as clean as possible,** make sure all the lights are on, and about an hour before the show, light a candle and blow it out before you leave.

This will set a great vibe to the house. It'll smell good. It'll be clean. It'll be lit up. This is exactly what buyers want to see when they're coming into your home.

If you need more help on how to improve your showings, call or email me. Iâ€™d love to connect with you.
