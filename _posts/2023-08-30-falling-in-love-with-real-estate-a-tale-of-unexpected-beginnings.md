Today I’ll be sharing my real estate journey; how I got started and fell in love with the industry.

I got into real estate in 2013 after my grandparents passed away. Their house was vacant, and I was unsure about my career path after finishing college. At the suggestion of my parents, I decided to pursue a real estate license. This was a new direction for me since I had a degree in marketing.

Getting my license was challenging; it took me multiple attempts, about five to seven, to pass the test. However, **once I succeeded, I listed the house and held an open house on the first Saturday after obtaining my license.** To my surprise, on that very night, I received an all-cash offer at full price with a five-day closing period. When the five days passed, a significant sum was deposited into my account. This experience made me realize my passion for real estate.

As always, if you have any questions about your real estate goals or need guidance with your buying and selling, don’t hesitate to call or email me. I’m always happy to help!
