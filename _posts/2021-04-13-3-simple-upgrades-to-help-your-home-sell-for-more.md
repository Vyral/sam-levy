Today, I want to talk about a couple of upgrades you can do to your home to improve its value before selling. These are very simple and easy to do:

**1\. Change the outdated countertops in your kitchen and bathroom.**&nbsp;A bright, white quartz or granite countertop can change the entire feel of the home.

**2\. Add a fresh coat of paint.**&nbsp;Choose a nice, neutral color to make the home feel vibrant.

**3\. Declutter and depersonalize.**&nbsp;This is an obvious one, but if you’re thinking about selling, decluttering and depersonalizing is so important and bear repeating. Not all buyers want to see those knickknacks and family photos throughout the home.

Doing these three things alone will help you increase your home’s sale price. If you have any questions for me, please don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
