My crucial tip for you today is about what not to do when getting a mortgage. It’s very simple—don’t take out any new and large debts. Don’t buy new furniture, a car, a boat, a trip, or anything else that might hurt your credit score or involve taking on new debt.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about this or want more tips like this, please call or email me anytime. I look forward to hearing from you.
