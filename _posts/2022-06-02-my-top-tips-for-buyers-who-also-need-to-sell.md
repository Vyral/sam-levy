Today I want to talk to the group of people who need to sell their current home to buy their next one. A lot of people are in this predicament, and it takes a skilled agent to juggle two transactions like this. **There are a few things you need to consider to prepare:**

**1\. Get your home ready to list.** I recommend some light touch-up work, deep cleaning, and getting the home ready for photography.

**2\. When will you close?** Your timeline needs to be nailed down. It can be hard to get deals under contract that are contingent upon you selling your current home first. You may need to think about finding a temporary rental or living with friends or family in the interim between closing on your sale and your purchase.

**3\. Get with a lender.** Get pre-qualified early in the process and start looking at homes before you list your property. You don’t want to list without seeing anything to buy first because you’ll get under contract quickly and may have to rent for a while until your purchase is finalized.

If you’re in a situation where you need to buy and sell simultaneously, I’d love to help. Reach out via phone or email today, and we can get the process started. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
