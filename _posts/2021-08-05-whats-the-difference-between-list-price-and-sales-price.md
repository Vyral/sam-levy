What’s the difference between a home’s list price and its sales price? A list price is what a home is listed for on the market. Its sales price is what the home actually sells for on the market.&nbsp;

**A good agent will suggest a price that is very similar to what they believe the home will sell for.&nbsp;**

If you have any questions about pricing or anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out. I look forward to hearing from you.
