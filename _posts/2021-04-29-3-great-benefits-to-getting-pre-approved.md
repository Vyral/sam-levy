When buying a home, there’s a big difference between a pre-approval and a pre-qualification. A pre-approval is a fully underwritten approval from a lender, and in this market, it’s critical to have one. Here are the three reasons why:

**1\. Certainty for yourself.** If you have a pre-approval, it’s almost a guarantee you’ll get the house you want at the price you want without having to go through further loan documentation.

**2\. Certainty for the seller.** When you provide a pre-approval instead of a pre-qualification, the seller knows you’ve been underwritten, the letter has collected all your documentation, and you’re good to go to buy.&nbsp;

**3\. You have less work to do.** When you apply for a loan, a lot of documentation needs to be submitted, and you have to do a lot of work to make everything happen. Getting a pre-approval means getting a lot of that work out of the way upfront.
