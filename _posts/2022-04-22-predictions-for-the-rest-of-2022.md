As all of you know, the Arizona market is extremely strong. We have very limited inventory and extremely high demand, and I believe this trend will continue for the foreseeable future.

If you've been thinking about buying, do it sooner rather than later before your purchasing power diminishes. **Interest rates continue to rise, and thereâ€™s no indication that the market is slowing down.** Even if interest rates go up another 1% or 2%, inventory is so restricted that prices will continue to rise regardless.

If you've been thinking about selling, now is an incredible time to list. Due to our high demand and low inventory, you can get an excellent price for your home quickly. Contact your real estate professional today to get the ball rolling.

If you have any questions about buying or selling, reach out to me by phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you.
