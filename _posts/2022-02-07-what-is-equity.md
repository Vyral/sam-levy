Equity is a buzzword in real estate that gets thrown around a lot. I think a lot of sellers and buyers aren't aware of what equity is how they can leverage it to their advantage, so today I’ll explain what it is and how you can use it.&nbsp;

**Equity is the difference between what you bought your home for and what it's worth today.** There are ways to leverage your equity. You could take out a home equity line of credit against that equity to purchase something else or pay off debt. If you're in that position, I'd be more than happy to connect you with a lender who specializes in HELOCs. Another thing you can do with equity is to sell the home and use that equity to buy another home.

If you're going to try to capitalize on equity after less than one or two years, be aware of capital gains tax. If you sell the house after less than one year, you’ll pay short-term capital gains, and if you sell it after less than two years, you'll pay long-term capital gains. **Consult with your tax advisor to learn more about capital gains and how much you'll have to pay.**

If you have any questions, visit my website and don’t hesitate to contact me by phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you.
