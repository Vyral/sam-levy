If you’re buying a home and are tempted to skip the home inspection, think twice before moving forward. You’ve probably heard it a million times: getting a home inspection is important. There are a lot of reasons for that, but I’ll break down a few of the most critical ones.

**1\. Find out the home’s true condition.** A home inspection reveals everything about the property you’re buying. Every single part of the house gets checked, from the condition and age of the AC unit to the plumbing, the electrical system, and more. A thorough inspection helps you avoid nasty surprises like a leaky roof or plumbing issues when you move into your new home.

**2\. It lets you renegotiate with the seller.** If the inspection reveals that something needs to be repaired or replaced, you can go back to the seller and renegotiate. You can either have them fix the issue before closing or ask for a credit to cover the repairs. This way, you can get repairs done after the deal closes without the added stress of unexpected costs.

**3\. Have peace of mind.** Buying a house is a huge decision, and you need to understand exactly what you’re getting into. A home inspection helps you feel confident about the biggest investment you’ll ever make.
