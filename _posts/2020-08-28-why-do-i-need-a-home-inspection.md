There are many reasons why it’s critical to get a home inspection when buying a house, but today I’m breaking down the three most crucial ones:

**1\. Condition.** An inspection will reveal the condition and age of the A/C unit, plumbing, electrical, and more. All the components of the home will be examined.&nbsp;

**2\. Renegotiation.** For example, if the roof needs to be replaced, you can go back to the seller and say, “The inspection says the roof is badly damaged. We need you to either replace it or give us a credit so we can replace it ourselves.”&nbsp;

**3\. Peace of mind.** You need to understand what you’re walking into when you purchase a house. You don’t want to be caught by surprise by a massive issue later.&nbsp;

If you have further questions about home inspections, buying, or selling, please feel free to reach out to me via phone or email. I would love to speak with you.
