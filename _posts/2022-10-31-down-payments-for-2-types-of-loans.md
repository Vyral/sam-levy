If you’re hoping to buy a home, you might be wondering: How much money do you need for a down payment with an FHA or VA loan?&nbsp;

With an FHA loan, you can put very little down, as low as 3.5%. These will have slightly worse terms, but it’s a government-backed loan, so **it’s a great product if you don’t have a ton of savings**.&nbsp;

With a VA loan, you can put as little as 0% down\! However, you have to be a military veteran to be eligible.&nbsp;

**If you think you’re a candidate for one of these options, reach out to a lender or me\!** I would love to answer any questions you may have. Please call or email anytime\!
