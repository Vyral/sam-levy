Today, I’m discussing how to prospect a neighborhood if you’re looking to buy. That means how to figure out what neighborhood you want to purchase a home in. This will be dictated by a few things.

**The primary factor is your price range**, which will determine which neighborhoods you can buy in. So, your first step needs to be getting pre-qualified with a lender. Your neighborhood will be mainly determined by what you want to spend on the purchase price and your monthly payments.

After that, you should figure out what your lifestyle is. Some people don’t care about lifestyle and only want to get as much square footage and land as they can, so if that’s you, that’s fine. However, if you care about your lifestyle, look at where your favorite restaurants and bars are, where your kids go or will go to school, what else is in the area, etc.

The next thing to consider is your commute times. Many people don’t want to spend 30 to 45 minutes twice per day going to and from work. However, if you don’t mind that, **your options will open up quite a bit.**

Next, think about your family. If you’re single, you may want to live in one area, but if you have a family or are considering starting one, you might want to look into different areas. **Generally speaking, you want to be around like-minded people**. If you have three kids, for example, you likely don’t want to live in Old Town Scottsdale. However, if you’re younger and don’t have kids, you may not want to live in a neighborhood that’s 95% families.

If you have any questions about neighborhoods or where might be a good area for you to buy in, please feel free to reach out to me via phone or my website. I’m always available\!
