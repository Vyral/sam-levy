Today I’m at Jimmy Vercillino’s office because he’s an excellent lender and Marine veteran. We’ll be discussing VA loans, our experience with them, and what it takes to get an offer accepted as a VA buyer in the current real estate market. Jimmy loves preaching information about the VA loan to help veterans build wealth through real estate. Many people are uninformed about the VA loan, but we’re on a mission to change that.&nbsp;

2:40—How I’m positioning veteran buyer’s offers

3:35—A VA buyer can be a challenge for a new agent

4:55—I believe we’re all on the same team: buyer, buyer’s agent, lender, title rep, seller, and listing agent&nbsp;

6:55—The selection of the right real estate agent is extremely crucial

9:45—Just because a veteran isn’t putting money down doesn’t mean they don’t have money in the bank; they’re just taking advantage of their benefits

10:50—The seller’s net profits from the sale won’t change if they accept a VA buyer’s offer

12:05—A veteran can borrow up to 100% of the home’s appraised value, but they also have the option to make up the difference between the purchase price and appraised value

13:10—Wrapping up today’s topic

If you have further questions about VA loans, getting your VA offer accepted, or anything else Jimmy and I talked about today, please feel free to reach out to either of us. We’re both here to be your resources. We’d love to help you.
