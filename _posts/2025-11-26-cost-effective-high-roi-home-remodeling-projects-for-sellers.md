*“Where should you spend your money if you want the best return on a remodel?”* This is one of the questions I get asked most often, and the truth is, it depends on your home.

Across the board, the two areas that almost always deliver the highest return are the **kitchen and the primary bathroom.** These are also the most expensive remodels you can do, so your budget really matters.

If you can only choose one, **I always recommend starting with the kitchen.** It’s the heart of the home where people gather, and the place buyers notice first. If you want a strong return without going overboard, here are four kitchen updates that make the biggest impact:

**• Update the counters.** A modern, clean counter surface changes the entire look of a kitchen. Even switching to a trendy color or finish can make the space feel fresh.

**• Paint or reface the cabinets.** You don’t always need to rip everything out. Painting or replacing doors is usually far more cost-effective than installing all-new cabinetry.

**• Swap out the appliances.** Newer appliances help buyers feel like the kitchen has been cared for, even if the layout hasn’t changed.

**• Freshen up the colors.** Sometimes a simple color update is all it takes to make the room feel modern again.

A typical kitchen remodel can cost anywhere from **$5,000 to $50,000**, depending on materials and the size of the space. Most of your cost comes from materials.

For example, imported Italian marble will cost far more than standard quartz or granite. And full cabinet replacements will always be more expensive than refinishing or painting them.

That’s why talking to a professional can help you figure out what’s worth upgrading and what you can skip.

When it comes to return on investment, kitchens historically give you some of the strongest payback. While it’s impossible to give an exact number for every home, most homeowners can expect somewhere between **$1.20 and $1.50** back for every dollar spent, depending on the style and finishes they choose.
