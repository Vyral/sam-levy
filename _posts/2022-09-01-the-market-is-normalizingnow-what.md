Are we in a seller's or a buyer's market? The short answer is that we're currently in a combination of the two.&nbsp;

During the last couple of years, we were undoubtedly in a strong seller's market. Interest rates were low and buyers were competing with each other to purchase their dream homes. However, due to rising inventory and increasing rates in the last couple of months, **the market is becoming more balanced and moving toward a buyer's market**.&nbsp;

Buyers have more opportunities today, while sellers can take advantage of the equity in their homes. If you want to learn more about how you can best navigate today's market or have any other real estate questions, please call or email me. I look forward to becoming your real estate consultant\!
