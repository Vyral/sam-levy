<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here’s what homebuyers (and sellers) should know about home appraisals.</em></p>

Today we’re going to look at what an appraisal is and how the appraisal process works. Essentially, an appraisal happens when a bank/lender sends a third-party appraiser to a home their buyer has made an offer on to determine its value and ensure that the purchase price and the loan amount are aligned. **This is one of the most important parts of a transaction** for several reasons.

For buyers, the appraised value must be at or above the purchase price. Let’s say the purchase price is $200,000 and the appraisal comes back in at $190,000. In this case, the $10,000 needs to be made up to get the deal done. **The seller could reduce their price, the buyer could increase their cash, or they could meet somewhere in the middle.&nbsp;**

Appraisals are incredibly important to every financed real estate transaction, and you need to be prepared for low appraisals as a buyer or seller in this market.&nbsp;
