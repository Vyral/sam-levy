Today’s video is a special one. We’re visiting with a couple of clients who just closed on their new home and happen to be very good friends of mine. **Chris and Tori Romero invited me to their brand new home to talk about their experience working with us, the plans they have for the new place, and how much they’re loving homeownership.**

Right now, they’re getting ready to take out the existing carpet and replace it all with wood floors. They’re also painting the walls white and installing brand new outlets. There were a lot of funky colors in the home from the previous owner, so they’re repainting everything to be more neutral and fit their style. They’re replacing the current kitchen appliances with stainless steel ones as well.

A giant safe in the middle of the master bedroom was an interesting thing to see. It’s bolted into the ground, so they’ll need to have that removed too.

**Here’s what Chris and Tori had to say about working with us:**

*“Our experience with Sam was great. He made the process extremely easy. It was obviously an easy decision to choose him, not only because we’ve been friends for a very long time, but he’s very knowledgeable, extremely smart, and very well-spoken. I’m extremely proud to call him my friend.”*

**We finished the trip by popping a bottle of champagne and toasting to Chris and Tori’s brand new home.** Thanks to them for trusting me, and I can’t wait to see what the future holds.

If you or someone you know has any real estate needs in the greater Phoenix area, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
