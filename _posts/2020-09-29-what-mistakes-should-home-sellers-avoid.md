<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here are the top three mistakes that sellers make when they sell their homes.</em></p>

Unfortunately, sellers who don’t know any better tend to make certain decisions that may come back to bite them in the end. Today I’ll share three of the most common mistakes that sellers make and what you should be doing instead if you want to find success in our market:

**1. Failing to consider the first offer they receive.** Often, when a home hits the market, people want to wait until they get multiple offers to start sorting through them. However, it’s not uncommon for the first offer to be the best one, so don’t discount it for the sake of it.
**2. Not decluttering or depersonalizing their homes.** You need to remove all your personal items that could deter or sway a buyer’s thoughts about your house one way or the other. That way, they can just see the bones of the property and get a feel for it.
**3. Not hiring a professional photographer.** Your Realtor needs to bring in a professional photographer to shoot photos of your home—a cellphone camera just isn’t going to capture your home in the right light in the way that the pros can.
