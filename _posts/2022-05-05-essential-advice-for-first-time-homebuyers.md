Today I have a few helpful tips for first-time homebuyers. This market can be a daunting environment to enter, but you’ll be better off by following this advice:

**1\. Have your financial ducks in a row.** Have your credit, debt, income, and down payment ready to go and get that info to the lender as soon as possible.

**2\. Make a list of your wants and needs.** Your needs may include things like three bedrooms or a two-car garage, while your wants might include items like a pool or spa. Address this list before entering the market.

**3\. Be prepared to lose.** Almost every home is receiving multiple offers, so you may have to lose a few before you win. Don't get discouraged because this is happening to everyone. We can help you succeed if you stick to the course.

If you have any questions for me, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
