Should you do open houses? This is a complex question. If you're an agent, you should be doing open houses. As a seller? Maybe. Sometimes they help you sell your house, but open houses are really for the agent to get leads. In my experience, **open house houses don't sell the homes, they sell the agent**.

If you’re a seller and you want to do an open house: Absolutely. Have your agent do it. Sometimes people do come through on the open house and purchase. Most of the time, it's for the agent to get exposure. Consider that when selling, and if you're an agent, make sure to do open houses.

For any questions about doing an open house or anything that’s real estate related, please call or email me. I’m always happy to hear from you!
