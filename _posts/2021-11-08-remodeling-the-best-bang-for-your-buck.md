One question I’m asked frequently is: “Where can I get the most bang for my buck when remodeling?” The answer depends on what your house looks like, but you'll probably get the best return from your bathroom and kitchen. These are also some of the highest-priced remodels you can do, so **keep your budget in mind.&nbsp;**

If you have to pick one, I suggest renovating the kitchen. The kitchen is where everyone spends the most time, and it’s one of the most visible places in your home. You may want to consider upgrading the counters, changing the colors to be more trendy, painting or redoing the cabinets, and updating the appliances. Doing these simple things will make your kitchen pop, and you’ll get more money for your home when you sell.

**A typical kitchen makeover can run you anywhere from $5,000 to $50,000** depending on materials, the size of the room, and more. Where you’ll run into major costs is with materials. For example, if you go with imported Italian marble, that’ll cost much more money than a more common granite or quartz. The same goes for cabinets; if you plan to improve your cabinets by ripping them out and installing new ones, that’ll be way more expensive than painting or refacing them. Consult with a professional before doing anything huge to help you decide what the most cost-effective option is.&nbsp;

It’s not easy to say exactly what your return on investment will be for a kitchen refurbishment, but depending on the finishes and style you go with, **you’ll generally get between $1.20 and $1.50 back per every dollar you spend.** That’s a 120% to 150% return, which is a very high ROI when remodeling.&nbsp;
