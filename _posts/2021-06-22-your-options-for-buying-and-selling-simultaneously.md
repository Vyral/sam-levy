If you need to buy a new home and sell your current home at the same time, you have a few different options.

**The most ideal is to buy first before you sell.** This can greatly help your chances of winning as a buyer. It’s important to make your offer stronger than you normally would because of how competitive the market is.

**You also have the option to sell first.**&nbsp;Then, you can either rent your home back from the buyer or rent another place until you find your new home.
