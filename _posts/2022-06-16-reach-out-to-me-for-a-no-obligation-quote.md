If you are thinking about selling your house, **I recommend you act sooner rather than later**. The current market is extremely compressed and has the most limited inventory in the history of the Arizona housing market. If you bought your home 40 years or even just 10 months ago, there’s a high guarantee that **you have a large amount of equity in your property.**

Please reach out to me if you’re considering selling your home or even if you’re still on the fence about it. I would love to give you a no-obligation quote. Call or email me any time. I’ll be happy to help\!
