When you’re selling your home, don’t overprice it. We all like to think our house is worth just a little more than the market says, but overpricing your home can actually cost you time, money, and peace of mind. Let me give you three reasons why.

**1\. It won’t sell quickly.** If your home doesn’t sell quickly, buyers start wondering, “What’s wrong with it?” The longer it stays unsold, the less appealing it becomes. That means fewer showings, fewer offers, and way less chance of getting what you’re really hoping for.

**2\. You’ll get lowball offers.** When buyers see a price tag that’s too high, some might come in aggressively low, trying to “balance out” what they see as an inflated number. And trust me, those kinds of offers aren’t fun to deal with.

**3\. You’ll feel disappointed.** For example, if your home is worth $500,000 but you list it at $550,000, even a fair $500,000 offer will feel like a bad deal. You might reject a great offer, thinking it’s not enough.

**What’s the solution?** Sit down with a real estate agent who knows the market inside and out. Look at the data together and set a price that makes sense. That way, you’ll sell faster, avoid headaches, and walk away feeling good about the whole process.
