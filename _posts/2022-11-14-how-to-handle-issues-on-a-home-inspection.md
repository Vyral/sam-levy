How do you handle issues on a home inspection as a buyer? This is a common question and one of the most important parts of the purchasing transaction. Luckily, it's very simple.&nbsp;

For any home inspection, regardless of the age, size, or location of the house, many things will be looked at. The report will be very long and involved. So how do you handle that? **I always recommend that my clients consider three to five items that matter the most to them.** These will generally include health and safety and water intrusion.

If you're thinking about buying a home, or you're in escrow right now, and you want to know how to handle home inspection, think about it that way, and donâ€™t hesitate to reach out to me by phone or email with any questions.
