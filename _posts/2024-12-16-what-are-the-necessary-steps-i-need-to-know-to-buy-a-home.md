I want to buy a house but don’t know where to start. Many people reach out to me asking about buying a home. They want to buy a house, but they're not sure about the process. Today, I'm going to give you a high-level overview of what to expect.

**1\. Get pre-qualified.** The first step is getting pre-qualified with a lender. This gives you an idea of your budget and helps you understand how much you can afford. If you already have a trusted lender, then that's great, but if you still need one, I'm happy to refer you to a reputable lender who can assist you.

**2\. Start shopping.** After getting pre-qualified, we'll start shopping in your price range and desired area. The price for which you're pre-qualified will dictate your options and guide your search for the right home.

**3\. Making an offer.** Once we find a home you love, we'll make an offer. The offer will be determined based on the comparable sales (comps) in the area and how much you’re willing to negotiate to get it.

**4\. Inspection period.** Once the offer is accepted, we move on to the inspection period, which lasts for ten days. During this time, we have the opportunity to inspect the home to ensure it’s in good condition and meets your expectations. The inspection will reveal any issues and may get some bids on any necessary work.

**5\. Appraisal process.** Once we clear the inspection period, we proceed to the appraisal process. Here, the lender will send a third-party appraiser to determine the value of your home and make sure it aligns with the purchase price.

**6\. Final walkthrough and closing.** After the appraisal, we’ll conduct a final walkthrough to ensure everything is in order before closing, and you’ll officially become the owner of your new home.

The process is pretty simple but you need the right guidance to make the whole process smooth and successful. If you have any questions or want more detailed information about what each step means, please feel free to call me at [(602) 501-9352](tel:6025019352) or send an email to [sam@thebrokery.com](mailto:sam@thebrokery.com).
