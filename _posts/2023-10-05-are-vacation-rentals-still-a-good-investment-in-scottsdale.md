Are AirBnbs going to collapse in Scottsdale, Arizona? If you’ve lived in the area or already have an investment there, you know that the town has been absolutely flooded with vacation rentals recently. Given this situation, many people have asked me if the Airbnb market will collapse in Scottsdale.&nbsp;

**In my opinion, vacation rentals are still a safe bet in Scottsdale.** If you have a great location, a good property, and the time to run things, this is still a fantastic investment.&nbsp;
