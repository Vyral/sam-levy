There is a lot of advice on what you should do when selling your house, but what about the things you *shouldn’t* do? Avoiding common mistakes can make selling your house quickly and with less stress. I’ll share three simple but important tips you should not do when selling:

**1\. Don’t make showings difficult.** While it can feel awkward to have strangers visit your home, showings are a big part of selling your house. You should be prepared to tidy up and leave the house for an hour or two when showings are scheduled, especially if they’re at decent, normal times.

**2\. Don’t let pets scare off buyers.** We all love our pets, but not every buyer feels the same way. If you have pets, it’s best to take them with you during showings. If that’s not possible, find a way to keep them somewhere safe so they don’t scare off potential buyers.

**3\. Don’t forget to depersonalize.** This can be difficult because our homes are filled with personal touches like family photos, artwork, and unique decor. But when you are selling, try to depersonalize as much as possible so buyers can visualize living in your space. It’s hard to do that if your personal items are displayed all over the place.

Following these simple tips can make your house more attractive to potential buyers. If you have any questions about selling your home, feel free to reach out at [(602) 501-9352](tel:6025019352) or [sam@thebrokery.com](mailto:sam@thebrokery.com). I’m here to help.
