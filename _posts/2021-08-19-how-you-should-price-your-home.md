Today I want to talk about listing prices. Is it better to list your home high or closer to what it will sell for? **The answer is very simple.**

An agent will often give you a high number to win the listing. Once they have your business, they put the home on the market for lower than they said. **The best strategy is to get a price that is close to what you think the home will sell for in today's market.** A lot of houses are selling over their list price, which is fantastic, but it's important that you don't get too greedy. Is it important to list your home high? Yes, because you can never raise the price, but it's also important that you price the home correctly so the home does not go stale on the market.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about how to price or buy a home, please feel free to reach out to me.
