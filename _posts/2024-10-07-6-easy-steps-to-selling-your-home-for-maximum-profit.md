I want to sell my home but don’t know where to start. This is a common concern, typically among first-time home sellers. Today, I’ll give you a broad overview of the home-selling process and how simple it is to profit from your house:

**1\. Take photos and a video of your home.** It’s best to take professional photos of your home to attract potential buyers as they view it online. Prepare your home by ensuring it is clean, depersonalized, and decluttered.

**2\. Get your home listed.** The listing will be posted on the MLS and syndicated to all the big websites, making your home officially available on the market.

**3\. Prepare for showings.** Expect a steady stream of potential buyers to view your home at different times of the day, anytime in a week. This means you need to be prepared to leave the house with an hour or two' notice to accommodate surprise viewings from potential buyers.

**4\. Expect offers and get under contract.** Pricing is crucial to getting competitive offers. A well-priced property will attract buyers, increase the chances of passing the appraisal process, and get a high offer. Overpricing can lead to appraisal issues, potentially delaying the sale or requiring negotiations.

**5\. Buyer inspection and negotiation**. A home inspection will be conducted similar to the one you had when you bought your current home. It’s a four-hour process during which the inspector thoroughly checks the property for potential issues. We’ll then review the inspection report and negotiate any necessary repairs or adjustments.

**6\. Final appraisal and closing.** Once the inspection is cleared and all agreements are in place, it’s time to close the sale, and you can officially move into your new home.

**Selling your home doesn’t have to be stressful.** With the right guidance and preparation, you’ll be able to breeze through the process and have a rewarding experience.
