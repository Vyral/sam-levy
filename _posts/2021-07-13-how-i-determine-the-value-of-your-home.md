Sellers frequently ask me how I determine the value of their homes. It’s a simple answer, but there are two main steps:

**1\. I’ll need to visit your home.** I’ll need to assess the home’s condition. When looking at Zestimates or other online estimates, it’s difficult to tell if they’re accurate because online algorithms don’t know if you’ve done upgrades, added square footage, updated the kitchen, etc. Your real estate agent needs to come to your house to get a comprehensive overview.

**2\. I look at comparable sales.** I’ll look at homes within a mile that have sold in the last six months or so that are of similar age and size to yours.

These two steps put together will allow me to come up with a fairly accurate estimate of the value of your home.
