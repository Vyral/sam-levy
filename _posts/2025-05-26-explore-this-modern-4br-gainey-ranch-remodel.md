You won’t find another remodel like this in Gainey Ranch. If you’ve been keeping an eye on the market in Scottsdale, you already know how rare it is to find a fully updated, thoughtfully designed, and move-in-ready home, especially in Gainey Ranch. This property at [**7511 E Woodsage Ln**](https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/7511-E-Woodsage-Ln-Scottsdale-AZ-85258/7859853_zpid/) is all of that and more. We’ve taken a solid home and elevated it to a new standard, with the kind of upgrades that look good and make everyday living easier and more enjoyable.

**This 2,600-square-foot home** has been completely transformed. It includes four bedrooms and two and a half bathrooms. The kitchen was opened to create a more functional layout and consists of a custom pantry that adds convenience and storage. We raised the sunken living room to align with the rest of the flooring, creating a smooth and cohesive flow throughout the home.

We added new windows to let in more natural light and create a seamless connection between the interior and exterior spaces. In the primary bedroom, we reworked the layout to enlarge the bathroom and the closet. The result is a spacious suite with a tub-and-shower combination that offers comfort and convenience.

The backyard has been completely redone with privacy and function in mind. New turf, updated pavers, mature ficus trees for added privacy, and a brand-new pool bring the whole space together. This home offers an outdoor setup you don’t often find, especially not in this price range.

**This is not your average Scottsdale remodel.** Homes like this are few and far between, especially under $2 million. With every major update already completed, this home gives you the freedom to move in and start enjoying it from day one, no additional work required.

If you’re looking for a standout remodel in one of Scottsdale’s most desirable communities, this is your chance. Don’t wait; homes like this move quickly.
