What goes into a home inspection when you’re selling a property? An inspector will look at every major and minor mechanical system. They’ll turn on the sinks, fans, and lights; then check every outlet, and get on the roof. They’ll also look in the attic, and test the AC and electrical panels. In short, **everything will be looked at**. If you’re selling or thinking about selling, and you know there’s something that needs to be repaired, I highly recommend getting it repaired before you list. If you don’t, be prepared for the issue to appear on the inspection report.

If you have any questions, reach out to me by phone or email. I’d love to help you.
