Are you torn between buying a new construction home or a resale property? I get this question all the time, and the truth is, the answer really comes down to your personal needs and preferences.

Here’s what you need to consider.

**The pros of new construction.** One of the major advantages is that the product is brand new. You have a lot of options when it comes to upgrades, which means you can personalize your space right from the get-go. Plus, builders often offer incentives that can make your purchase more attractive.

However, there are some cons to consider. New homes are generally located farther out from city centers, which can mean longer commutes. And while you can choose some upgrades, you’re often locked into what many of the homes look like on the outside. If you’re in a new neighborhood, you might notice that every house tends to look similar.

**The pros of resale properties.** The good thing about resale homes is that you’ll often find these homes in more densely populated and up-and-coming areas, like central Phoenix. This can be a huge advantage if you want to be close to amenities and the vibrant community life.

Another plus is that you can remodel resale homes to fit your style. Whether it’s updating the kitchen or adding a personal touch, you have the flexibility to make it your own.

But keep in mind, there are some downsides to resale homes as well. They’re generally more expensive, so you’ll need to factor that into your budget.
