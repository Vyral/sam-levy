Today I want to talk about the pros and cons of buying a home with a pool. Some of the pros are pretty straightforward.&nbsp;

For example, it’s hot here in Arizona, so it’s fun to have a pool in your backyard every day. **They also really help your resale value,** because a lot of buyers will still be looking for one when you eventually decide to sell.

That being said, pools don’t come without a few drawbacks. The maintenance is one. **You’ll have to invest time and money into keeping the pool up.** A pool service will cost you a few hundred bucks a month. You’ll also have to pay for resurfacing when the pool’s surface starts to crack. In this climate, pool surfaces crack earlier than they’re supposed to. This can cost you anywhere from $8,000 to $15,000 depending on the size and age of the pool.

When you go to buy a home, you need to decide whether or not you want to have a pool. How much will you use it? If you want one and will use it frequently, go for it. If you won’t, it might not be worth it.

If you have any questions about buying a home with a pool, installing a pool, or anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
