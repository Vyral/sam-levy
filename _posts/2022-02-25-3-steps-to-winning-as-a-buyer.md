There are three things that you need to do to win as a buyer in this market. **The first step is getting pre-qualified with a lender before you start shopping.** This tells you how much you can afford, and I’m happy to refer you to a great lender.&nbsp;

After you’re approved, it’s time to get competitive with your offer. Listen to your agent’s recommendations if you want to get the house.&nbsp;

Finally, don’t get discouraged. You’ll likely lose out on a few houses because the market is so competitive, but trust in your agent to make it happen, and you’ll reach your goals.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about the market or real estate in general, please don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon\!
