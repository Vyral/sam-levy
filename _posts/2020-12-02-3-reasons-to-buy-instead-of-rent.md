<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here are three great reasons to consider buying a home instead of renting.</em></p>

Here are a few reasons why it’s better to buy than to rent:

**1. Paying your own mortgage.** You’re paying your own mortgage instead of your landlord’s. When you’re a renter, there’s still a mortgage on the property, but you’re paying the landlord, who in turn, pays the mortgage.&nbsp;

**2. You can make the home your own.** When you purchase a home or condo, you can do whatever you want to it. For example, if you own the house, you can remove plants or paint rooms any color you desire.

**3. Interest rates are great.** Currently, rates are at almost historic lows. If you are able to purchase, the money’s practically free. It’s at least worth looking into and getting a professional opinion.&nbsp;
