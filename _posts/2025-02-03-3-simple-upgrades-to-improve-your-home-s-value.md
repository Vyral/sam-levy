What simple home upgrades can you make to improve the value of your home? If you’re planning to sell your home, you may be led to believe that the more upgrades you make, the higher you can list for. But sometimes, a few minor upgrades are all it takes to help increase its value. Here are three easy changes that can make a big difference:

**1\. Update your countertops.** Start with the countertops in your kitchen and bathrooms. If they’re outdated, think about upgrading to new white or bright quartz or granite. These materials can modernize your home and make it feel more inviting.

**2\. Freshen up with paint.** Another easy upgrade is a fresh coat of paint. Choose a nice neutral color for the walls to create a warm, welcoming vibe. You can also paint your cabinets in a similar tone. This will make your home feel vibrant and open, which is attractive to potential buyers.

**3\. Declutter and depersonalize.** Decluttering is crucial when selling your home. Begin by taking out personal items like family photos and toys. A clean, organized space helps buyers envision themselves living there, making your home feel more spacious and welcoming.

Once you’ve made these upgrades, consider getting professional photos taken. Good images can attract more buyers and help you get a better price.
