Recently we've heard a lot of news about inflation and a recession. Are we in a recession, and what's inflation doing? What are our interest rates doing? There are things everywhere to consider. In my opinion, if you need to buy a home, now is a great time to make a move. Yes, interest rates are higher than they were, but you can always refinance down the road and lock your money in for a guaranteed 30 years.

If you're thinking about buying, make sure you consult a lender and a Realtor and do it sooner rather than later. The reason to do it is a real estate property is an investment. You need somewhere to live, and it's an appreciating asset. **Not many things you can buy with or without debt appreciate the same way as real estate.**

Another reason is it's just an accessible way to grow your wealth. It's really easy to do it. If you can afford the payment and afford the down payment, it is part of your money there, and boom, you're growing your net worth over time. And lastly, you need a place to live. Everybody needs a place to live. Rent is not getting cheaper. If you can lock your rate in once again and it's affordable, you have the option to refinance later. **Lower your payments, still hold the home, and have a place to live for you and your family.**
