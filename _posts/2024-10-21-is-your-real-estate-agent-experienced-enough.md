Does experience really matter when hiring a real estate agent? The answer might be obvious to some. However, you’ll be surprised by the number of people working with inexperienced agents, especially in Arizona. While I have nothing against inexperienced agents, in this particular market, it is critical that you hire a professional real estate agent with experience for several reasons.

**1\. Protect your interest.** Buying or selling a home is one of the biggest, most important decisions you’ll ever make. That’s why you need someone who sees value in that and will take care of you throughout the process. An experienced Realtor will be on top of things and will not miss any deadlines or parts of the transaction. Taking care of you means having your best interests at heart.

**2\. Negotiation skills.** An experienced real estate agent knows how to negotiate effectively, whether you’re buying or selling. An agent with years of experience would know how to bargain effectively and secure the best possible terms and prices for their clients. A strong negotiator will help you get across the finish line efficiently.

**3\. Strong network of professionals.** In addition to their knowledge and skills, an experienced agent has established relationships with various professionals, including lenders, title companies, inspectors, and more. When your agent has a team of reliable professionals, the buying or selling of a home becomes more efficient and smoother.

You need the best of the best, whether you’re buying or selling. Without someone with experience, it will be hard to access the best resources. I can go on about all the tradespeople in my network and all the different types of professionals who can make the buying or selling process easier for you.
