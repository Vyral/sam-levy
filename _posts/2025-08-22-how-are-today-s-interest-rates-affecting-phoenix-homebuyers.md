*“Can I still afford to buy a home?”* It’s a question most buyers are asking right now, and much of that concern comes back to interest rates. Rates play a big role in how quickly homes sell, how they’re priced, and how affordable they feel.

Over the past couple of years, they’ve stayed relatively flat, but constant news coverage has created the impression that they are incredibly high. But what people feel doesn’t always match reality.

**Rates are not historically high, but buyers still feel they are.** Compared to long-term trends, today’s rates are not at unusual levels. What matters most, though, is how buyers perceive them, and many buyers feel they’re too high for homeownership to be truly affordable. That perception alone is enough to slow down decisions and keep people on the sidelines.

**There are ways to make monthly payments more manageable.** The important thing to remember is that options do exist. While rates themselves may not be dropping dramatically, there are strategies you can use to lock in lower interest rates or reduce your monthly payments. Exploring these options can make the difference between waiting on the sidelines and moving forward with confidence.

If you’ve been weighing how interest rates affect your ability to buy, now is a great time to get clarity. Let’s talk through the strategies that can help make homeownership more within reach.
