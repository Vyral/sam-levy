If you’ve been touring homes or scrolling through listings in Phoenix, you’ve probably heard terms like en-suite bathroom or Jack-and-Jill bathroom tossed around.

They sound simple, but many buyers aren’t fully sure of the difference or why it actually matters. Here’s what they mean:

**What is an En Suite Bathroom?** An en-suite bathroom is directly connected to a bedroom. In most homes, this is the bathroom attached to the primary bedroom, though guest bedrooms can also have en-suite bathrooms.

The key feature is private access. The bathroom can only be entered from that bedroom.

**What is a Jack-and-Jill Bathroom?** It’s a shared bathroom located between two bedrooms, with a separate door connecting to each room.

Both bedrooms have direct access, but neither has exclusive ownership of the bathroom.

Now, when you hear en suite bathrooms or Jack and Jill bathrooms, you’ll know exactly what’s being described, and why it matters.
