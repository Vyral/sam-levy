Today I want to briefly explain the difference between an en suite and a Jack and Jill bathroom. Now and then, you’ll hear these buzz words thrown around, and I just wanted to quickly clear it up.

**An en suite bathroom is connected to a bedroom. A Jack and Jill bathroom is between two bedrooms that feed into the same bathroom.**
