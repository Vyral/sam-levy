Why does experience matter when hiring a real estate agent? It’s very common, especially in Arizona, to work with someone who doesn’t have much experience in this market. But when you’re making a major life decision, it’s critical you hire a professional with experience for a number of reasons.

**First, you want to make sure that you’re being taken care of.** Buying or selling a home is the largest financial decision that most people will ever make in their lives. You want your agent to be on top of things, not missing any deadlines or parts of the transaction and have your best interest at heart.

**Second, you want to make sure that someone knows how to negotiate**, whether you’re selling or buying. A strong negotiator on your side will help you get across the closing table.

**Lastly, you need someone who has a good network of professionals**, such as lenders, title companies, inspectors, and more. I can tell you more about the tradespeople I trust in my network, covering all different types of professionals. If you don’t have someone with experience, it will be hard to access the best resources.

You need the best of the best when buying or selling your property. If you have any questions about buying or selling or what my personal experience looks like, reach out at [**(602) 501-9352**](tel:6025019352) or [**sam@thebrokery.com**](mailto:sam@thebrokery.com). Let’s connect!
