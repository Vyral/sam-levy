There are numerous investment strategies in real estate, and one of the most advantageous for young buyers is house hacking. **House hacking involves purchasing a home, typically with multiple bedrooms, and renting out the spare rooms.**

One of the primary benefits of this strategy is the additional rental income generated. For instance, if your monthly mortgage payment is $3,000 and you have a three-bedroom house, you can rent out two of those rooms for $800 each, depending on the local market conditions.

The key advantage is that most of your mortgage expenses can be covered by the rental income from your housemates. If you're interested in building wealth through real estate but have limited capital or are unsure where to begin, I highly recommend exploring the concept of house hacking to see if it's a feasible option for you.

However, there are a few factors to consider on the downside, primarily the aspect of having roommates. If this doesn't pose a problem for you, I strongly encourage you to explore this investment strategy.
