As a buyer, you always need to have a home inspection done. Don’t feel pressured into not getting one. There are many reasons why a home inspection is beneficial, but here are three of the main ones:

**1\. Peace of mind.** When you get a home inspection, you know what’s going on with the home. Inspectors check everything so you know what you’re buying.

**2\. You know what costs are involved.** For example, if the house needs new plumbing, and it’ll cost $10,000, you’ll find that out and have the opportunity to cancel the contract if you don’t have the financial ability to pay for it or simply don’t want to deal with it. You’ll still get your earnest money back.

**3\. Present findings to the seller.** You can present the inspection report to the seller and ask for a credit to repair things yourself, have them repair things, or meet somewhere in the middle. They could also reduce the price of the home to reflect what you’ll have to pay for repairs. If you can’t come to an agreement, you can cancel the contract and get your earnest money back.
